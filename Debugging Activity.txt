Hit F8 until s++ is reached

Hit F8 until program crashes

	j = 4

	Cause of crash: As it's traversing the array to sort,
	it is checking each index of the array against the
	next one to see if the values need to be swapped. When
	it gets	to the last index of the array it is once again
	trying to check the next one, but there isn't a next
	one, so it's going out of bounds.

	Fix: To account for that we need to protect against the
	last index checking beyond it's bounds while still
	allowing the variable count to decrement enough times to
	go through the process enough times to finish sorting all
	the way to the end.
